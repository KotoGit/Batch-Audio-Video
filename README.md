# Batch Audio Video

Creates cuts based on videos from the user's timestamp(s). Output can be either video or audio only.

Usage:  
1. Place batchav.py in the folder with your video  
2. Run the program as: python3 batchav.py "file_with_timestamps" "video_filename"

Notes:  
1. Requires python 3+  
2. Currently only works in a Linux terminal  
3. The file_with_timestamps must be formatted correctly - no error checking yet

file_with_timestamps format:  
00:00:00-00:01:27  
00:21:06-00:23:56
